# Base Attributes

Base attributes are part of the base nav mesh and is generally used in all games.    

## Crouch

Can be toggled with the `sm_nav_crouch` command.    
Tell bots they need to crouch to traverse this area.    

## Precise

Can be toggled with the `sm_nav_precise` command.    
Tells the bot's navigator to more precisely follow the nav mesh and also disables the navigator's local obstacle avoidance, meaning bots won't try to strafe left or right to avoid collision.    

## Stop

Can be toggled with the `sm_nav_stop` command.    
Tell bots to stop moving briefly upon entering this nav area.
